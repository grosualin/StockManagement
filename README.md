‚úÖ Products
- Display all products with search functionality 
- Product Detail: View and edit product information 
- Add/Edit Product: Form to add new products or edit existing ones

‚úÖ Suppliers
- Display all suppliers with search functionality 
- Supplier Detail: View and edit supplier information 
- Add/Edit Supplier: Form to add new suppliers or edit existing ones

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The app follows Clean Architecture principles and the MVVM architecture, using Repository pattern.
The app has the following structure and layers:

- Presentation Layer : UI, ViewModels, Models, State (LiveData, RxJava), Custom Views 
  - Responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.
  - Uses usecases to interact with data and maps domain model to ui models.
- Domain Layer: UseCases, Interfaces, Business Models
  - Holds usecases and business models.
  - Responsible for business logic and data processing.
  - A usecase combines one or multiple repositories and performs a specific business operation by implementing business logic.
  - Maps data models to domain models.
- Data Layer: Local (Room DB, DAOs, Entities), Remote (API services, DTOs), Mappers
  - Two data sources: local DB and remote (mocked api service)
  - Responsible for fetching and storing data.
- Dependency Injection: Modules, Components
  - Provides a mechanism for injecting dependencies into classes.
  - Uses Dagger 3 for dependency injection.
  - A module tells Dagger how to provide dependencies to other objects.
  - A component tells Dagger which modules to use in order to create objects.

## Tech Stack:
- Kotlin 2.2+
- Material Design 3
- Room (offline persistence)
- RxJava3 (reactive data handling)
- Dagger 3 (dependency injection)
- Jetpack Navigation
- ZXing (barcode scanning)

## üìå Assumptions & Design Decisions
- RxJava is used to manage reactive data flows and combine local/remote sources with Single.concatArrayEager.
- Room entities use @Embedded and @Relation for nested structures like ProductWithSupplier.
- Entity IDs are not autogenerated and must be explicitly provided for syncing.
- Product and transaction relationships are many-to-one (product has one supplier, transaction has one product).
- Search operations are optimized with debounce to limit frequent queries.
- I assumed that data coming from backend (api) must always override local data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Limitations
- No remote authentication or multi-user support implemented.
- Large lists are not paginated.
- No specific filter implemented on any of the listing pages, only search functionality
- The only implemented bonus feature is the barcode scanning feature.
