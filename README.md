## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
The app follows Clean Architecture principles and the MVVM architecture, using Repository pattern.
The app has the following structure and layers:

- Presentation Layer : UI, ViewModels, Models, State (LiveData, RxJava), Custom Views 
- Domain Layer: UseCases, Interfaces, Business Models
- Data Layer:
  - Local (Room DB, DAOs, Entities)
  - Remote (API services, DTOs)
  - Mappers

## Tech Stack:
- Kotlin 2.2+
- Material Design 3
- Room (offline persistence)
- RxJava3 (reactive data handling)
- Dagger 3 (dependency injection)
- Jetpack Navigation
- ZXing (barcode scanning)

## 📌 Assumptions & Design Decisions
- RxJava is used to manage reactive data flows and combine local/remote sources with Single.concatArrayEager.
- Room entities use @Embedded and @Relation for nested structures like ProductWithSupplier.
- Entity IDs are not autogenerated and must be explicitly provided for syncing.
- Product and transaction relationships are many-to-one (product has one supplier, transaction has one product).
- Search operations are optimized with debounce to limit frequent queries.
- I assumed that data coming from backend (api) must always override local data

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations
- No remote authentication or multi-user support implemented.
- Large lists are not paginated.
- No specific filter implemented on any of the listing pages, only search functionality
- The only implemented bonus feature is the barcode scanning feature.
